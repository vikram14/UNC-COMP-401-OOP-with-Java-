# UNC-COMP-401-OOP-with-Java-
The course has an end goal of building an interactive programming language, similar to scratch, that helps absolute beginners to visulaize what certain strcutures like for loops do, using the repeat() command and so on, by simulating the famous bridge scene in the movie Monty Python. In this course we created a command interpreter using threads, MVC, and the concepts of OOP and good program design. Each assignment builds up to this main goal.
NOTE: an assignment numbered higher on this list will contain the previous assignments because each one forms a layer on which the next assignemnt can be implemented.
